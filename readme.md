#Emyl

Emyl is a C++ toolkit for OpenAL abstraction. Its name is a recursive acronym for "Emyl Makes You Listen".

It's self-contained within a few files that you can easily copy and compile into your application. It creates an abstraction for playing sounds and music, for avoiding to deal with OpenAL sources and buffers. Emyl supports OGG for sounds and music.

Emyl 2.0 is based 99% in SFML Audio. The 1% is: emyl is one header and one cpp and it uses C++11.
